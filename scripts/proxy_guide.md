# Proxy guide

Guide for Proxy contracts

## Overview

We are using Transparent Proxy pattern from the Upgradeability using Unstructured Storage.

## How to deploy a Proxy Contract of an Implementation

1. Deploy a Proxy instance of `OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy` using *proxyOwner* deploy account
2. Deploy an instance of the Implementation contract `Implementation`. This contract is the logic contract where all the functions are contained (without a constructor).
3. Run the upgrade and call function from the Proxy instance. Example:
    
    `const tx_no_init = await OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy_instance.upgradeTo(Implementation_instance.address, {from: proxyOwner});`
    
    or

    `const tx_with_init = await OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy_instance.upgradeToAndCall(Implementation_instance.address, [initializeParameters], {from: proxyOwner});`

    where the `initializeParameters` are parameters passed to the `initialize` function of the `Implementation` instance. Note that in the intitialize parameters different address is added as the *owner* of the Implementation instance (different from *proxyOwner*). 

4. Then, running functions using the Proxy instance is by using the Implementation ABI with the Proxy instance address attached:

    ```
    const Implementation_ABI = await ethers.getContractFactory('ProxyImplementation');
    const ProxyContract = await Implementation_ABI.connect(owner).attach(OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy_instance.address);
    const getInfo = ProxyContract.getInfo();    
    ```

    Note that `owner != proxyOwner`

For deployment examples check the deployment scripts used for `ProxyThalesExchanger`
[scripts/l1_l2_exchanger/deploy_proxy_exchanger_only](https://github.com/thales-markets/contracts/blob/main/scripts/l1_l2_exchanger/deploy_proxy_exchanger_only.js)

### Automatized OpenZeppelin solution 

More automated and straight-forward solution is using the OpenZeppelin hardhat solution:

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/hardhat-upgrades

NOTE: there might be an issue if in the `initialize` function of the `Implementation` contract there is a gas-consuming or function that calls external contract. The automated deployment of OpenZeppelin may brake during deployment. 

When using this method, the verification steps are different

1. Deploy using the openzeppelin guide (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/hardhat-upgrades)

2. Get the implementation address form the .openzeppelin/network-netID.json

3. Verify the implementation, using the address from 2).

4. Verify the proxy using the link:

## How to upgrade a Proxy Contract with a new Implementation

1. Deploy an instance of the new `Implementation_V2`
2. Run `upgradeTo` in the Proxy instance of the `OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy`:

    `const upgradeToNew = await OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy_instance.upgradeTo(Implementation_V2_instance.address, {from: proxyOwner});`

3. The state from the old contract is perserved. Additionally the new functions added in the `Implementation_V2` can be called

    ```
    // getInfo will be the same
    const getInfo = ProxyContract.getInfo(); 

    // getAdditionalInfo is enabled only after upgrade. In previous implementation did not exist
    const getAdditionalInfo = ProxyContract.getAdditionalInfo()
    ```
## Important requirements

There are few important key requirements for Contracts to be upgradable in the Proxy patterns.

1. **Implementation contract is only the logic (the definition of functions and variables). The Proxy instance is where the variable states are stored (storage).**

    Hence with every new implementation, the state and the storage is not changed. Only additional variables can be append, but can not be deleted.

2. **Implementation contract can not have `constructor()` function**

3. **Implementation contract can not have variables pre-set, unless they are constants.**

4. **Implementation contract should not have *selfDestruct()* function**

5. **Order of variables declared in the new Implementation can not be changed**

6. **In the new implementation new variables can be only appended**
